# Nectar

It stands for Nim Event Completion Toolkit for Asynchronous Routines

Nectar is a high-performance, cross-platform I/O completion-based event handling library for the Nim programming language.
It provides a unified API that wraps the underlying primitives of epoll, poll, select, kqueue, and IOCP, allowing developers to write efficient, asynchronous network applications with a powerful and efficient IOCP-like interface.
Nectar is designed to be fast, lightweight, and easy to use, making it an ideal choice for building scalable, concurrent systems.
